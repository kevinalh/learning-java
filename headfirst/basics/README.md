These are basic example of classes in Java. Note that each file has to contain a single class, and that the entry point
of the application is the `main` function.

To compile them, use `javac DooBee.java`, which will generate a `DooBee.class` byte-code file.
To run them on the JVM, use `java DooBee`.
